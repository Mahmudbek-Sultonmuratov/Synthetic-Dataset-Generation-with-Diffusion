# ROADMAP

This file will be updated weekly with milestones, owners, and due dates.
# ðŸ“… Project Roadmap

## Week-by-Week Timeline

- **Week 1**: Finalize proposal, select datasets, define scope
- **Week 2**: Implement baseline classification pipeline (real-only)
- **Week 3**: Build synthetic image generation pipeline using SDXL; prompt engineering
- **Week 4**: Filter and validate generated images; augment dataset
- **Week 5**: Retrain model on augmented data; begin evaluation
- **Week 6**: Run ablation studies (sample count, prompt diversity)
- **Week 7**: Final analysis, visualization, and report writing
- **Week 8**: Polish final submission and prepare presentation
